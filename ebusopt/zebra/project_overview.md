## Zero-Emission Bus Range & Recharging Assessment

### Welcome to ZEBRA! ü¶ì
This app explore the possibilities and challenges associated with converting a given transit bus fleet to use battery-electric buses. We perform some data processing and analysis to identify range requirements, challenging routes, and possible layover/opportunity charging locations.

### Navigating the app
 * Use the pages seen in the **‚¨ÖÔ∏è left-hand sidebar** to navigate through data selection and results presentation. For best results, move through the pages in order from top to bottom.
 * Need more help? Check the **`‚ùìHelp`** tab on each page for instructions on providing inputs, suggestions for interpreting results, and details on our methodology.
 * **:blue[Tip]:** Keep an eye on the top-right corner of your screen for the `üèÉ RUNNING...` icon that shows when processing is still happening in the background. For best performance, avoid navigating to a different page while the app is still running.  


### The Team
The project is based in the University of Washington's [Intelligent Urban Transportation Systems (iUTS) Lab](http://depts.washington.edu/iuts/). This tool does not require much technical knowledge, but some familiarity with transit terminology and with the GTFS data standard will be helpful. With questions and feedback, please contact lead developer Dan McCabe at [dmccabe@uw.edu](mailto:dmccabe@uw.edu).
