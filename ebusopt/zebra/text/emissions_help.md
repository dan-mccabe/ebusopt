 ### Overview 
On this page, you can see estimates of the emissions reductions resulting from a potential BEB fleet conversion.

### Instructions
Make sure that you've set an appropriate bus range on the :violet[**ðŸ“ŠRange Requirements**] tab, as this will impact the breakdown of potential emissions benefits across in-range and out-of-range blocks.

### How It Works
Using GTFS data, we sum up the total distance of all active blocks on your chosen day of analysis, divided into the two categories of in-range and out-of-range blocks. We then multiply these distances by some emissions intensities per miles based on average figures reported in Transit Cooperative Research Program Report 226 (National Academies, 2021). This report estimated average emissions intensities of 3.05 kg CO2e/mile for diesel buses, versus 0.97 kg CO2e/mile for battery-electric buses. The exact emissions impacts for a particular agency will vary based on a large number of factors including current bus fuel efficiency and emissions intensity of local electricity, but the figures we report should give a solid back-of-the-envelope estimate.
