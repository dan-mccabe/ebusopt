### Overview
This page helps you dive deeper into blocks outside of your specified range and examine potential locations for layover charging. On the :violet[**🪫 Hardest Routes**] tab, you can see which routes feature most often on out-of-range blocks. :violet[**🚌 Longest Blocks**] lets you explore all out-of-range blocks in detail, and :violet[**📍 Recharging Map**] plots where out-of-range buses are located between trips to help identify potential fast-charging sites. 
    
### Instructions
First, make sure that you've set the bus range value correctly on the :violet[**📊Range Requirements**] page, as this directly impacts the results you see here. The table on :violet[**🪫 Hardest Routes**] will then show which routes feature most often on out-of-range blocks. :violet[**🚌 Longest Blocks**] is more interactive. When "See all" is selected, ZEBRA presents a table of all blocks sorted by total distance that also lists the routes served by each block. You can use the "Select a Block" dropdown to pick a specific Block ID (which will also appear in the table below). From here, you can either click "See all block data" to view a table of all relevant GTFS data that ZEBRA compiles, giving full details of each trip on the block. Alternatively, you can click "Map this block" to see all trips in the block on a map of your region.
